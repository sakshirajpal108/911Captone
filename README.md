911 Calls Capstone Project: Using Python with Numpy and Pandas


This project is mainly based on analyzing 911 emergency calls data. This data set has been taken from Kaggle.com. This project includes exploratory data analysis of the 911 calls data and data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries. I have used Jupyter notebook for this project. The project reveals details like main reasons behind 911 calls and frequency of calls.
